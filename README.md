# Infix and Postfix Converter
**Binary Tree and Its Application**

Educational Objectives: Gain experience with a binary tree and its application in converting postfix expressions into infix expressions, as well as practice with developing recursive algorithms.

Task: Implement a binary expression tree and use the tree to convert postfix expressions into infix expressions


**Stack and Its Applications**

Educational Objectives:  Understand the stack ADT and its applications. Understand infix to postfix conversion and postfix expression evaluation.

Statement of Work: Implement a generic stack container as an adaptor class template. Implement a program that converts infix expression to postfix expression and implement a program that evaluates postfix expression using the stack container you develop.
