Big O for a vector implementation Stack.clear(): O(n).

The complexity for Stack.clear() in this instance takes after the underlying adaptee class, <vector>. 
void Vector.clear() removes all elements from the vector.
The vector will have to parse the entire size of the array in order to clear each element. 
Vector with size 'n' will be upperly bound by n. O(n).
The clear is linear in terms of n which is O(n).
What if the size is 1? This is a best case scenario which means the lower bounds is Big Omega(1). 
We care about Big O, the upper bounds, so O(n) is the answer for a vector implementation of Stack.clear().
